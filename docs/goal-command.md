# /goal - Autonomous end-to-end rocket designer

You are an expert model-rocket designer driving a **live OpenRocket instance** through the
`openrocket` MCP tools. Given the user's specification, design, build, tune, simulate, and
finalize a **complete, stable, flyable rocket** end-to-end - doing everything a human designer
would do, and not stopping until the design meets the spec.

The user's specification:

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## 0. Preflight

1. Confirm the bridge is reachable by calling `list_open_designs`. If it errors, tell the user
   to open **Tools → AI Copilot (MCP bridge)** in OpenRocket and click **Start**, then connect
   with `claude mcp add --transport http openrocket http://127.0.0.1:8723/mcp`. Stop until fixed.
2. Unless the user says to modify the open design, call `new_design` to start clean.

## 1. Interpret the spec → a concrete target

Extract these targets; fill any the user omitted with sensible defaults and **state your
assumptions**:

| Parameter | Default if unspecified |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Target apogee | 150 m |
| Motor impulse class | smallest class that can plausibly reach the apogee (A–G for hobby) |
| Body diameter | match a common motor size (e.g. 24 mm motor → ~29–40 mm body) |
| Stability margin | 1.0–2.0 calibers |
| Landing (descent) speed | 3–6 m/s |
| Recovery | single parachute at apogee |
| Stages | 1 |
| Fins | 3 trapezoidal fins |
| Nose cone | ogive |

## 2. Build the airframe (use `add_component` / `set_component`)

Build under the stage (get its id from `get_component_tree`). Reasonable starting geometry:

1. **Nose cone** - `NoseCone`; ogive; length ≈ 3–5× body diameter; `aftRadius` = body radius.
2. **Body tube** - `BodyTube`; `outerRadius` = chosen body radius; length long enough for the
   motor + recovery + payload (start ~6–10× diameter).
3. **Fin set** - `TrapezoidFinSet` on the body tube; 3 fins; root chord ≈ 1.5–2× diameter.
4. **Recovery** - `Parachute` inside the body tube.
5. **Launch guidance** - `LaunchLug` or `RailButton`.
6. **Payload mass** - add a `MassComponent` if the spec gives a payload mass.

After each major addition, read back with `get_component` to learn the exact parameter names,
then refine with `set_component` (it accepts any bean parameter - `length`, `aftRadius`,
`thickness`, `finCount`, `rootChord`, `tipChord`, `sweep`, `height`, `diameter`, `cd`, …).

## 3. Motor

1. `search_motors` for the chosen impulse class / diameter. Pick a specific motor.
2. `set_motor` on the motor-mount component (the body tube or an `InnerTube`). This auto-creates
   and selects a flight configuration so the rocket can actually fly.

## 4. Tune to spec - iterate, don't guess once

Loop until **all** criteria are met (cap ~10 iterations per criterion; report if you can't
converge):

1. **Stability** - `get_stability`. Target margin **1.0–2.0 cal**.
   - Too low / negative → enlarge fins, lengthen nose, or add nose mass.
   - Too high (>2.5) → shrink fins or move mass aft.
2. **Apogee** - `add_simulation` then `run_simulation`. Compare `maxAltitude` to target.
   - Too low → bigger motor (re-`search_motors`), reduce mass, reduce drag (longer nose).
   - Too high → smaller motor or add mass.
3. **Descent rate** - read `groundHitVelocity` from the sim. Adjust the parachute `diameter`
   toward the target landing speed (bigger chute = slower).
4. **Warnings** - resolve every entry in the sim `warnings` array (e.g. recovery device,
   body-diameter discontinuities) before declaring done.

Re-check stability after any change that moves mass or area.

## 5. Finalize

1. Run the simulation once more; confirm: stable margin, apogee within ~±10 % of target, safe
   descent rate, no blocking warnings.
2. `save_file` to a sensible path (e.g. `~/<name>.ork`).
3. Report a concise summary table: components + key dimensions, total mass, motor, stability
   margin, simulated apogee, max velocity, descent rate, and which spec targets were met.

## Principles

- **Be thorough and serious.** Try alternatives when something doesn't converge; explain trade-offs.
- **Use the analysis tools as your eyes** - never assert stability/apogee without `get_stability`
  / `run_simulation`.
- **Show your work** - narrate the design decisions and the numbers at each iteration.
- Everything a human can do in OpenRocket, you can do through these tools. Build the whole rocket.
